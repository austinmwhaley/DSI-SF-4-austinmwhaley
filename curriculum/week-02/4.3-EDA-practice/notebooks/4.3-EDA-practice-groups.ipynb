    "The time has come to take our game underground.  Our company is being hired to provide insights to a government contract entity that may provide metrics in which to potentially evaluate emerging crypto-currencies.  Understanding these markets will help ongoing and future investigations of illegal underground marketplaces operating from [darknets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_market).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Invent some quality metric(s) to help us measure these currencies\n",
    "- Project any kind of lifetime of given market\n",
    "- Volatility \n",
    "- Impact of \"minability\" on any of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "### End with addressing this one question:  If one were to open or operate an illegal marketplace, which currency is preferable?\n",
    "The point of this exercize is to assess the viability of this dataset to answer the questions of interest.  If the dataset cannot address these questions effectively:\n",
