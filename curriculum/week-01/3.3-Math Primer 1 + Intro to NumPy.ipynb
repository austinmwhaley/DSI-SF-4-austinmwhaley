Thus, we use inferential statistics to make inferences from our data to more general conditions; we use descriptive statistics simply to describe what's going on in our data.  Classic **descriptive statistics** include **mean, min, max, standard deviation, median, skew, kurtosis**. Inferential statistics are a function of the sample data that assists you to draw an inference regarding an hypothesis about a population parameter."
